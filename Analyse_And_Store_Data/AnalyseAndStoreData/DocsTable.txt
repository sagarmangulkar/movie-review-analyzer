0052.html Review for Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) Steve Fritzinge      No one told Eddie Murphy and Robert D. Wachs that originality counts when
they were writing BEVERLY HILLS COP II.  Only the names (of the villains) and
the crime have been changed to make this sequel.  The first 10 minutes of
BEVERLY HILLS COP II convinced me I was in for a long 2 hours.  20 mi NA
0036.html Review for Raising Arizona (1987) Gary Benson
    CAPSULE: Terrific fun, probably destined to become a cult classic. 
      This is the most fun I've had at a movie since BRAZIL.  (Before BRAZIL, it
was SILVER STREAK).  That should tell you something about my orientation, so if
you *hated* BRAZIL, you can probably stop reading now and assume y NA
0021.html Review for Lethal Weapon (1987) Jeff Meyer
          LETHAL WEAPON tends to be one of those marginal, on-the-border films; its
qualities and weaknesses are glaring, and tend to cancel one another out.  The
story, which is nothing special, centers on an aging family-man police
detective (Danny Glover) who is saddled with a series of drug-related c NA
0035.html Review for Sherman's March (1986) Tod Kuykendall
      SHERMAN'S MARCH is an interesting, somewhat offbeat movie by an indie
filmmaker.  A brief summary follows: 
 Scene New York:
     Young struggling filmmaker from the South gets a grant to make a
documentary about General Sherman's devastating march through the South.
Before he can start, h NA

        ...I was born in 1967, I am a big fan of EC Comics-style horror tales
of the early 60's.  CREEPSHOW and CREEPSHOW II [directed and screenplay by
George Romero, based on stories by Stephen King] certainly pay homage to these
comics, fondly perpetuating the style and its numerou NA
0019.html Review for Raising Arizona (1987) Mark R. Leeper
 :  A frantic and funny comedy about an
     ex-con who steals a baby to have instead of the one his wife
     cannot have.  The BLOOD SIMPLE Coen brothers have made a
     second great film.  It's a screwball comedy filled with
     screwball characters.

0024.html Review for Blind Date (1987) Mark R. Leeper
 :  Slapdash comedy really shows up the
     deterioration of Blake Edwards's style.  Two funny scenes and

      Blake Edwards has been making comedies for a long time.  He may be best
known for the Inspector Clouseau films that starred Pet NA
0040.html Review for Sherman's March (1986) Jeff Meyer
          It doesn't happen very often: you go to see a film that everyone--and I

a wonderful movie.  And you sit through the film without enjoying it one whit.
As I said, unusual; that you should be the only one who fails to NA
0068.html Review for Believers, The (1987) Mark R. Leeper
 :  Ugly, unpleasant urban horror film
     about a voodoo-like religion in New York City.  There is
     nothing original or creative and little enjoyable in the
     film.  If John Schlesinger can make films like MIDNIGHT
     COWBOY, that's really what he should be doing.

0079.html Review for Project X (1987) Mark R. Leeper
 :  Very (very) familiar story about an Air

     one would expect it to be.  Nothing great, but well worth

          After the last Bond flick I thought that 007 was dead.  The plot had

0117.html Review for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) Mark Rosenzweig      This has got to be the worst movie I've blown five bucks on in a very long
time.  Parts of it were, however, so bad that they were funny (Look, up in the
sky, it's a bird, it's a plane - it's a statue! ).

0017.html Review for Evil Dead II (1987) Mark R. Leeper
 :  There's more budget than logic to this

          This is certainly one of the more unusual films to come along during the

words, the film is about a community in Wales, and (properly) the actors speak
in Welsh, with English subtitles.  The story is reminiscent of the ol NA
0042.html Review for Extreme Prejudice (1987) Jeff Meyer
          Warning: anyone offended by blatant, leering machismo had better avoid
this film.  Or lots of blood & guts, men against men and mano-et-mano stuff. 
      In other words, it's a Walter Hill film!  With a John Milius script!  I

 :  Big mythic cops-and-robbers film is
     long on excitement, short on accuracy, brash and colorful.

          I recently had the--um--opportunity to see BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE
